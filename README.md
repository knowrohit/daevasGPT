# DaevasGPT: An AI-Maximalist Approach to Artificial General Intelligence ðŸ§ 

Daevas is an ambitious and interactive project that harnesses the power of cutting-edge transformer models to push the boundaries of artificial general intelligence (AGI). The script utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to create a versatile and adaptive chatbot capable of tackling a wide range of natural language processing tasks.

# ðŸŒŸ Features
Daevas aims to emulate human-like understanding and reasoning by seamlessly integrating various language-based capabilities. The chatbot can:

- Answer questions: The chatbot is designed to understand and process user queries and provide relevant, accurate responses. It can efficiently handle a wide range of topics, from general knowledge to specific domain-related questions.

- Summarize text: Daevas can extract the most essential information from a given text and present it in a concise, coherent summary. This feature is particularly useful when you need a quick overview of lengthy documents or articles.

- Write code snippets: The chatbot can generate code snippets based on user requirements, effectively bridging the gap between natural language and programming languages. This feature assists users in quickly prototyping or learning new programming concepts.

- Translate between English and Hindi: Daevas is capable of translating text between English and Hindi, allowing for seamless communication between speakers of these languages. It leverages advanced language models to provide accurate translations while preserving the original context and meaning.

- Analyze sentiment: The chatbot can assess the sentiment of a given text, determining whether it expresses a positive or negative emotion. This feature is valuable in understanding customer feedback, social media content, and other text-based data that conveys emotions.

## AI-maximalist approach: Daevas represents the vision of AI-maximalism, aiming to explore the full potential of artificial intelligence and push the boundaries of AGI

- It strives to go beyond traditional chatbots and provide a more comprehensive and intelligent conversational experience.

- MPT-7B decoder-style transformer: Daevas is built on the powerful MPT-7B model, which is a decoder-style transformer pretrained from scratch on 1T tokens of English text and code. This model, trained thoroughly offers high throughput efficiency and stable convergence.

- Efficient training and inference: Daevas incorporates performance-optimized layer implementations and Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi), enabling fast training and inference. It can handle extremely long inputs, making it suitable for various tasks.

- Commercial use license: Unlike some models, Daevas is licensed for the possibility of commercial use, offering flexibility for different applications and purposes.

- Open-source training code: Daevas is built on the mosaic. The open-source nature of the training code promotes collaboration and further advancements in the field.

- Toddler and Infant models: Daevas includes two variants of chatbot models. The MPT 7B based GPT model is named "toddler_daevas.py," while the models based on Bert and ChatGLM are named "infant_daevas.py." Each model offers unique capabilities and functionalities.
